Elite users have a slightly larger average star rating than non-elite users

Some interesting insights to considerâ€¦

Elite users may have higher standards since they need to meet certain criteria to earn their status

Elite users may also be more active on Yelp and have more experience. This is backed up by the previous slide where elite users accounted for 45% of the total reviews while only 4.6% of the total users

Can we predict that a review was written by an elite or non-elite reviewer?

Random Forest Classifier  

Split the data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.

Evaluated our models performance using MulticlassClassificationEvaluator & accuracy metric.

Our model accuracy was 85.89% for correctly predicting test data. However, after plotting the ROC curve. The AUC was 0.66.

This suggests that the model is just slightly better than random at distinguishing from elite and non-elite reviewers.

Logistic Regression

70/30 Split

Model accuracy was slightly better at 86.79%.

AUC score: 0.78

This indicates that the model has a relatively strong ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes
